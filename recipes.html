My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.<br>

<li>All-purpose flour</li>
<li>Natural unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>Baking soda</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
</ul>

   <ol>
   <li>Wash and place chicken wings in a bowl</li>
